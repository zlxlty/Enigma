* For `Windows` 7+ **ONLY**

## Instruction
### Basic Function
To use the `Enigma simulator`, you just have to `double click` the `Enigma.exe`  
A terminal-like window will appear with output as followed:
```
ENIGMA MACHINE

Enter the Sequnce of the Rotor:
```
As most of other ciphers, `Enigma` requires key to encrypt and and decrypt messages  
I am simulating an early version of `Enigma` which has three keys:
* The Sequence of `Rotors`: A **three-digit number** made up of `1` `2` `3`
* The initial position of each `Rotor`: **Three English letters**
* The settings of `Plugboard`: **Six pairs of letters**

There is no need for you to know all the theories and processes behind the mechanism of `Enigma Machine`. If you are interested, you can go to [this website](http://enigma.louisedade.co.uk/howitworks.html) for more information

This is a sample setting for `Enigma Machine`. You can use any valid combination you like.  
After entering the keys, the arrangements of all the `Rotors` will be printed on the window:

This is just for visual effect and debug. You can simply ignore it.
```
Enter the Mode(E or D):
```
There are two mode to chose from:  
* **`Mode E`** means en/decrypting only one letter at a time, making it more realistic comparing with the real machine.
![image]()
* **`Mode D`** means en/decrypting one sentence at a time. However, all the `rotors` will return to their original states once a sentence is en/decrepted.

The program will then ask students to fill in their **name**, **email** and **grade** for registration.  
Here is an example:
```
Enter your first name:	tianyi

Enter your last name:	lu

	 0 people have already signed in.

Enter your Email:	tylu17@uwcchina.org

Enter your Grade (FP or DP1 or DP2):	dp1

THANK YOU!
```

***
### Special Feature
* **SPACE** `''` will be identified as invalid input
```
Enter your first name:

Enter your first name:

Enter your first name:

Enter your first name:

Enter your first name:

Enter your first name:
```
* **Name repetition** can be detected by comparing with names in `data.txt`
```
Enter your first name:	tianyi

Enter your last name:	lu

You have already signed in!
```
* Only **UWC School Email** that end with `uwcchina.org` can be accepted
```
Enter your Email:	2924312854@qq.com

Please Enter the CORRECT school Email!
```
* **Expired** school email is invalid
```
Enter your Email:	tylu15@uwcchina.org

Email expired!
```
* Grade other than **`FP`**, **`DP1`** or **`DP2`** is invalid
```
Enter your Grade (FP or DP1 or DP2):	dp4

Please enter the CORRECT Grade!
```

***
### Reminder
* For students who are not familiar with terminal operation, please remind them to press **`Enter`** every time they finish typing.
* The number of students in `data.txt` and `members.txt` must be the same.

## Hello_World
`Hello_World.py` program is used for registering people who are interested to join this zhixing.  
I will explain `classes` and `functions` in this file respectively
```python
class CODE_with_UWC(object):
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    def mission(self):
        pass
```
The only application of this `class` is to print the mission of this zhixing

```python
def name_repetition(fname, lname, members, index):
    pass
```
This function will check whether the name input is in `memebers.txt` already  
if the name dose repeat, the function will return **`TRUE`**, otherwise it will return **`FALSE`**

```python
def clear():
    pass
```
Once a student finish all the inputs, this function will be used to clear the terminal  
All the information will be temporarily stored in a `list` of `dictionaries`. Then, those `dictionaries` will be `serialize` by `json` and stored in `data.txt`

***
## verify
`verify.py` includes many functions that are used to validate user's input such as `first name`, `last name`, `email` and `grade`.

```python
def verifyed_fname():
    pass
def verifyed_lname():
    pass
```
Those two functions will return verified names if the input is not `''` or `'\n'`

```python
def verifyed_email():
    pass
```
This function only return valid email address if and only if the address end with `uwcchina.org` and the year number is in `16`, `17`, `18`  
```python
m = re.match(r'^\w+?(\d{2})@uwcchina\.org$', email)
```
`Regular Expressions` is used to comparing the `expressions` with the `input`

```python
def verifyed_grade():
    pass
```
It will only return one of the valid grades in UWCCSC

## txttodic
```Python
import json

def getdata(filename):

    members = []
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f.readlines():
            dic = json.loads(line)
            members.append(dic)

    return members
```
This function can transform serialized content in `data.txt` to a list of dictionaries

***
The results will be recorded in `members.txt` so that my girlfriend can make an Excel sheet out of it conveniently

Introduction:
-------------
  This is a simulator of Enigma machine which is a kind of cipher ued by Germany army in the WW2.

Instruction:
-------------
  I will use an example to show how this program work.
  Firstly, we enter every components of the key. In this case they are `123` (the rotor sequence) `TIP` (the rotors` starting positions) and six pair of random letters. On the console interface, the inputs are operated as followed

  Then the corresponding rotor settings will be automatically printed

  After that, we need to enter the letter of `plaintext` (HELLOWORLD) one by one and ciphertext will be printed in the following position.

  Finally, we end the input with the symbol '-' and the complete plaintext and ciphertext will be shown again.

  Reminding that all the letters must be `capitalized` and space is `not` accepted.

  We can also check whether the encryption is right by using the same key to encrypt the ciphertext we got previously.
